## Chick weights

The `ChickWeight` data set is part of the base package `datasets`. See `?ChickWeight` for details on the data.
For all of the questions use `dplyr` functions whenever possible.

1. Download the RMarkdown file with these homework instructions to use as a template for your work.
Make sure to replace "Your Name" in the YAML with your name.
2. Get a frequency breakdown of the number of chicks, their average weight and the standard deviation of the weights in each of the diets at the start of the study. <br>
 0.5 pts of extra credit: construct a ggplot that shows average weights by diet with an interval (shown as a line) of +- the standard deviation around the averages.
3. Each chick should have twelve weight measurements. Use the dplyr package to identify how many chicks have a complete set of weight measurements and how many measurements there are in the incomplete cases. Extract a subset of the data for all chicks with complete information and name the data set `complete`. (Hint: you might want to use mutate to introduce a helper variable consisting of the number of observations)
4. In the complete data set introduce a new variable that measures the current weight difference compared to day 0. Name this variable  `weightgain`.
5. Use ggplot2 to create side-by-side boxplots of `weightgain` by `Diet` for day 21. Describe the relationship in 2-3 sentences. Change the order of the categories in the Diet variable such that the boxplots are ordered by median `weightgain`.


Note: your submission is supposed to be fully reproducible, i.e. the TA and I will 'knit' your submission in RStudio. 


For the submission: submit your solution in an R Markdown file and (just for insurance) submit the corresponding html (or Word) file with it.
