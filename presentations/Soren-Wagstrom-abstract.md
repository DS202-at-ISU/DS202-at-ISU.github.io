## The Numbers Behind Popular Music

Our team investigated the factors behind popular music. We used a dataset detailing the top 5000 songs of all time. We explored how different factors such as genre, descriptors, and artists affect the score, how the popularity or score of genres changed over time, and the popularity of songs released in different periods of time. We also looked at the relationship between the number of reviews per artists.
