<p>The goal in studying this topic was to see the relationships between flights and the amount of wildlife strikes. In doing this, many tools and charts were used in order to show various aspects of this relationship. This is because there can be many different ways that the two variables can portrayed, such as, by time, by month, and by state. This project was setup in the way that we started with the background, and discuss flight 1549, which was one of the most well-known flights to strike wildlife and then later landed safely in the Hudson River. Then transitioning from that, the background of the overall data set is discussed, and then the finding from this data sets are shown and discussed. In working with the data set, there were actually some pretty surprising findings, such as, some of the most common times of the day and months of the year that these wildlife strikes occurred were actually not entirely what would have been expected, including a spike in incidents late at night for almost every year observed.</p>
