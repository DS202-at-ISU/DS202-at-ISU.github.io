## Analysis of Vehicular Crashes in Iowa

The Iowa Department of Transportation provides vehicle crash data from January 2009 until present, with data on date, time, location, cause of crash, road and weather conditions, etc. being reported. The goal of this project is to use this data to analyze meaningful correlations between crashes and their potential causes. Our analysis includes looking at sunset and sunrise time in relation to crashes as well as the patterns of drunk driving during certain times of the day or week. This analysis can provide a meaningful look into what correlates with crashes in Iowa so that better safety policies can potentially be enacted in the future.
