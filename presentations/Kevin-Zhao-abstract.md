## Diabetes in Iowa

Our main goal is to analyze individuals who have diabetes and what features relate to it.  The data was collected via a phone survey, either landline or cell phone.  Each row contains an ID, the year the interview took place, whether the data was partial or complete, and so on.  Demographic information for each individual like age, sex, race, marital status, education level, etc. could help us better understand the demographics of those who have diabetes.  Behavioral information tells us how often people exercise, eat fruits/vegetables, and so on.  We also have health information that tells us all the major conditions that an individual may have other than diabetes.
