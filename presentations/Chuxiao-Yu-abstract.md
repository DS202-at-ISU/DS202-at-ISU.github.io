## Data exploration on four-year-plan graduation rate

The project is about some data exploration on four-year-plan graduation rate with different colleges. We are going and answer and explain the following questions:
1. Visualize the percentage of student who fail to graduate each year.
2. Is there any evidence to say that there is some relationship between year number of graduates and graduating rate?
3. Find the summary of graduating rate in different district.
4. What is the trend of graduating rate over year?

Since the dataset we use initially does not have a lot of columns, so we are also using other datasets to support our exploration.
