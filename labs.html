<h2>Lab assignments</h2>

<p>
Every other Wednesday (starting Feb 12) we will make use of the class time to work on a lab. You will be randomly assigned two or three lab partners.
Labs are meant to be finished in class, but you are allowed to put on finishing touches and submit the final versions by 11:59 PM the following Monday.
